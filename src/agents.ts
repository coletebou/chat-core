/**
 * Agents in a chat, as another service sees them (D205): a message that names an agent is
 * delivered to it as an event, POSTed to the agent's own webhook; the agent answers through the
 * chat app's API with a bearer token of its own. This module is that protocol's shape and its
 * signing, for both ends: the app signs what it sends, the agent checks it, with nothing but the
 * Web platform (Web Crypto, TextEncoder), so it runs the same in Node, Bun, Deno, a Worker or a
 * browser.
 *
 * A delivery carries four headers (`AGENT_HEADERS`): what it is (`chat.mention`), its id (the same
 * on every retry of it, so a receiver can drop a repeat), when it was signed (Unix seconds), and
 * its signature: `v1=` and the hex HMAC-SHA256, keyed by the secret the two share, of
 * `${timestamp}.${body}`, the exact bytes sent. A receiver checks the signature over the raw body
 * before parsing it, and refuses a timestamp more than five minutes from its own clock, so a
 * delivery caught on the way cannot be replayed later. While a secret is being changed the
 * signature header may carry two `v1=` values, one for each; either one matching will do.
 *
 * Every address an event gives is a path on the chat app's own API (`reply.path`, an image's
 * `path`), never a whole URL: the agent puts in front of it the address it was configured with
 * for the app, and sends its token there and nowhere else. An origin taken from a request (its Host
 * header) could otherwise name any host, and the agent would hand that host its token.
